  about_section_africa_desc: `I was born in Mbuji-Mayi late 70s in what we used to call Zaïre. What looked at that time as normality with my African eyes appeared to be a callous existence for my future European eyes. We used to have less than nothing, but I cannot remember a day I was not HAPPY. That taught me that no matter life's hurdles and difficulties, smile, and everything would be OK!`,

    "I used to think that Europe was in the sky when I was young in Africa. When I landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport in 1989, the images on TV of people breaking the Berlin Wall, crying, and hugging burned into my memory. I immediately understood that observation and fast learning fast were paramount to survival.",

  experience_section_desc:
    `I got 15+ years of experience in Finance. I started within the hedge fund sector, with an important role in selling major restructuring and derivatives-based financial products at a country level. Wishing to change from that highly political sector, I explored the popular technology sector to work for Microsoft at their European HQ in Ireland as a project manager, which created a strong foundation for my career in technology. However, it brought me back to my calling into the banking world again, working with major international banks.<br/><br/>
As I started a new family, I moved back to France and worked for Big 3 Bank. Some of my tasks and responsibilities in this corporate finance role ranged from economic modeling, risk management, financial planning, and wealth management, dealing with institutions and UHNWIs. I have managed over $2.5 B in AUM and over 800 corporate accounts throughout my banking and wealth management career.
<br/><br/>
Later in the banking sector, I was introduced to network marketing. I succeeded easily due to my client management and relationship skills, earning a 7 figure yearly income. That made me start my full-time entrepreneur journey, with a move to Gold mines from a request made by a former client. I reconnected with my roots and relatives in the DRC to commence the Gold trading business.
From there, I had to build an investment holding company and diversify into real estate, cryptocurrency, app development, and diverse red and blue ocean businesses.
